  "Using get_it, class types can be registered in two ways.

  Factory: When you request an instance of the type from the service provider you'll get a new instance everytime.
  Good for registering ViewModels that need to run the same logic on start or that has to be new when the view is opened.

  Singleton: Singletons can be registered in two ways. Provide an implementation upon registration or provide a lamda
  that will be invoked the first time your instance is requested (LazySingleton). The Locator keeps a single instance of
  your registered type and will always return you that instance."
